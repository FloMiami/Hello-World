        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <article>
            <p>I go to school at Dominican University in River Forest, IL majoring in Informatics. I’ve had several classes based on information technology. Recently, I have been taking the SecurityPro course with the goal of earning my CompTIA Security+ Certificate. Other relevant coursework includes Data Science and Programming in Java. I have a passion for learning and researching new technologies. In the summer of 2023, I earned a grant to research and report on the new artificial intelligence systems being used for educational purposes across the world. My research was truly global, preparing me to understand the information technology landscape of many different countries. My goals are to make improvements in emerging technology to ensure a safer, more protected environment while increasing profitability as a result.</p>

            <p>My previous work experience has been primarily in business logistics. During the summer of 2023, I worked at Ryder (NYSE: $R), one of the biggest logistics companies in the world, as the shipping coordinator using ticketing software to receive shipping requests. I was also in charge of picking, packaging, and handling, as well as leading my team of e-commerce employees. I have worked in similar roles at Menards during the summer of 2022 and Walmart in the summer of 2021.</p>

            <p>I also do volunteer work, helping Eerie Neighborhood House in Little Village, IL, as a student mentor. I love giving back to the community and seeing the difference I can make. I also regularly volunteer at my university’s food pantry "DuEats."</p>
